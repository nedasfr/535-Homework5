This is a README file for the baltimore_data, which is created for Homework 5 of the 535ERHS class at CSU.
This respiratory includes Washington Post data on homicides in the US.

The data and the graph shows monthly homicides in Baltimore, with a reference added for the date of the arrest of Freddie Gray from November through April versus warmer months from May through October. 

The Baltimore graph is saved as the Baltimore.png that shows the aforementioned data.
